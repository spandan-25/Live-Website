                Everyday I wait for your message... when it comes finally, my friends say I become more energetic and fun. 
                The days I talk to you feel like those few minutes were the highlight of my day.  
                I know you are really busy, but I hope you can take out some time every day for just us.  
                <br><br>
                I don't know how you'll react to this, but I really have two goals in my life... get a decent job and live with you.  
                I am stretching myself every day, pushing myself so I can be with you. Nothing else can be a better prize for me.  
                <br><br>
                I know we have been on only five dates... but they were enough to make myself think and imagine us together.  
                Bbg, God has given me everything that I have asked Him for and truly deserved.  
                Now I just want to win you over.  
                <br><br>
                Trust me, the distance is just a test of how tough days can be in the future, all I need you to do is believe in me.  
                I'll fix everything. ‚ù§Ô∏è
